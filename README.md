## MIDI CC Mapping

> [!TIP]
> These default MIDI CC mappings can now be customized directly in the app via **Advanced Settings**!

## Development

Built with:
- Vue.js 3 with TypeScript
- WebMIDI.js for MIDI communication
- Vite for build tooling

### Project Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

## Troubleshooting

### MIDI Connection Issues
1. Ensure WebMIDI is supported in your browser
2. Check USB cable connection
3. Verify Zoom L6 is powered on and in MIDI mode
4. Try refreshing the device list and select the correct device (this varies by OS)
5. Check debug console and browser console for error messages

### MIDI Not Responding to Controls
1. Verify the correct MIDI input/output devices are selected
2. Check if your Zoom L6 uses different MIDI CC mappings - use **Advanced Settings** to customize
3. Ensure the MIDI channel matches your device (default is Channel 1)
4. Check for duplicate CC assignments in Advanced Settings
5. Try resetting to default settings in Advanced Settings
